# 🎨 Cartoon API

Welcome to **Cartoon API** — an open-source initiative focused on the development of **REST APIs for cartoon universes**, created by developers for developers.

Our goal is to provide **well-structured, well-documented, and reusable APIs**, aimed at bots, websites, games, studies, and educational projects.

> ⚠️ All APIs here are **unofficial** and fan-made.  
> No images or copyrighted material are distributed.
